Happy New Year!!! I was out late!!! Got home around 4am in the morning. Soon
after I bid farewell to a friend that was visiting over the holidays. I stayed
in bed until pretty late and didn't get to start off my morning ritual. Later I had coffee and then dinner with a friend.

Stayed up until 1.30am or so. Got up early enough to take a walk out and run
through my morning ritual. Completed first day of 30days of JSâ€“Awesome stuff.
Trying out a Pomodoro timer to keep myself focused. I'll see how that pans out.
I drank more water today than I did the entirety of last week! On my evening
ritual!

Got up pretty late for someone on a mission :-P but for the first time I don't
feel guilty. It was the first day back at work so there was plenty to catch up
on and people to chat with. Even with all of that, I was able to knock out most 80-90% of what I set out for the day
so pretty excited. Found out a co-worker got a promotion right before the break
so we're gonna get turnt soon. It's great celebrating other people's success. I
got the second day of 30days of JS!.

This week is definitely the first week back. I was super productive for
most of the day. Made good use of my Pomodoro clock and oh yes, I got a standing
desk last week. It's kicking a$$ so far :). Today's Katie's first full day in
the US and she's up and about. Completed day 8 of JavaScript30
