Happy New Year!!! I was out late!!! Got home around 4am in the morning. Soon
after I bid farewell to a friend that was visiting over the holidays. I stayed
in bed until pretty late and didn't get to start off my morning ritual. Later I had coffee and then dinner with a friend.

Stayed up until 1.30am or so. Got up early enough to take a walk out and run
through my morning ritual. Completed first day of 30days of JSâ€“Awesome stuff.
Trying out a Pomodoro timer to keep myself focused. I'll see how that pans out.
I drank more water today than I did the entirety of last week! On my evening
ritual!
