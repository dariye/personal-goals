Happy New Year!!! I was out late!!! Got home around 4am in the morning. Soon
after I bid farewell to a friend that was visiting over the holidays. I stayed
in bed until pretty late and didn't get to start off my morning ritual. Later I had coffee and then dinner with a friend.

Stayed up until 1.30am or so. Got up early enough to take a walk out and run
through my morning ritual. Completed first day of 30days of JSâ€“Awesome stuff.
Trying out a Pomodoro timer to keep myself focused. I'll see how that pans out.
I drank more water today than I did the entirety of last week! On my evening
ritual!

Got up pretty late for someone on a mission :-P but for the first time I don't
feel guilty. It was the first day back at work so there was plenty to catch up
on and people to chat with. Even with all of that, I was able to knock out most 80-90% of what I set out for the day
so pretty excited. Found out a co-worker got a promotion right before the break
so we're gonna get turnt soon. It's great celebrating other people's success. I
got the second day of 30days of JS!.

Glad to be feeling much better after a very feverish start to the day. Stayed home
because of the fever/cold. Spent some quality time watching TV with my roommate.
Completed day 3 of JavaScript30.

So it was the flu after all and my mom almost convinced me it was malaria. Not in
Amurica! Well I made some pepper soup (without habaneros unfortunately) to soothe my throat :). Heard from my good friend Abhi today! Completed day 4 of JavaScript30.
