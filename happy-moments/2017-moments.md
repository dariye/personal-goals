Happy New Year!!! I was out late!!! Got home around 4am in the morning. Soon
after I bid farewell to a friend that was visiting over the holidays. I stayed
in bed until pretty late and didn't get to start off my morning ritual. Later I had coffee and then dinner with a friend.

Stayed up until 1.30am or so. Got up early enough to take a walk out and run
through my morning ritual. Completed first day of 30days of JSâ€“Awesome stuff.
Trying out a Pomodoro timer to keep myself focused. I'll see how that pans out.
I drank more water today than I did the entirety of last week! On my evening
ritual!

Got up pretty late for someone on a mission :-P but for the first time I don't
feel guilty. It was the first day back at work so there was plenty to catch up
on and people to chat with. Even with all of that, I was able to knock out most 80-90% of what I set out for the day
so pretty excited. Found out a co-worker got a promotion right before the break
so we're gonna get turnt soon. It's great celebrating other people's success. I
got the second day of 30days of JS!.

Super chill day today. Katie's visiting from the UK! Also, I somehow got excited about
having an impossible date alignment for the entire year so like Sundays are 1/7  ... 1/8 ... 1/15 ... and so on. But you get the gist. lol smh at my stupid feats. Tejas had to remind me of Spent some quality time with my roommate Tejas watching TV and enjoying some YouTube video. Also, Ken my roommate might be my new philosophy buddy. Day 7 of Javascript30.

This week is definitely the first week back. I was super productive for
most of the day. Made good use of my Pomodoro clock and oh yes, I got a standing
desk last week. It's kicking a$$ so far :). Today's Katie's first full day in
the US and she's up and about. Completed day 8 of JavaScript30

# 01/10/2017
The standing desk is doing me a lot of good so far. I get more done! Overall
good day at work. Submitted my application for a new I-20 yay! Watched some TV with my roommate-The Daily Show with Trevor
Noah. Ruth my cousin is on her way here to complete the rest of her studies at
Syracuse...cannot wait! Completed day 9 of JavaScript30. Taking an early stab on a nice issue on
the hyper project by zeit.co

was a slow day but got to connect with Evan regarding professional/personal
goals as well as Joe. Overall I feel good. Completed day 10 of JavaScript30.

I have my third visitor of the year crashing my couch and counting. Imo's has an interview with
NYU's med school where he's looking to do his residency. I hope he gets it! The
weather was well over the 40s today in NYC. Now that's good day in winter :). I
watched a few episodes of Marco Polo. One of my goals this year is to stay as
much away from TV as possible. Starting my first skunk works project tomorrow so
pretty excited. It's gonna be a visualization of our open source work at Andela.
Completing the most exciting project of JavaScript30 so far. Day 11 almost
complete.

# 01/13/2017
In the spirit of having a year's commit streak, I'm gonna cheat a little and
enter today's entry a little early. Hanging out with Katie & Russell later
tonight. It's dinner then off to a bar. Resumed communications training today
with Steve. I've improved as a communicator but with so much room to get better.
Began working on my open source data viz project for Andela. It's the first on
my list of skunk work projects.  

# 01/15/2017
Happy to be back on track with my daily entries and personal goals. I find that
the more I hit my goals at work. the less I hit my personal ones. Spoke
extensively with Peace today. She's now a mature and responsible young woman.
Decided no more netflix for the time being. Completed day 14 of JavaScript30.

MLK Day! Really productive day. The trick to getting to good enough is to trust
in your plans. I did that today. I met up with Pat, talked about implementation
details for Esusu and had lunch. Smart dude! Soon afterwards, I caught up with
my good friend Vid and Shaun. They're both taking on an interesting problem in
the health sector. Always exciting to hear about their victories and challenges.
Finally confirmed appointments to hunt for Nanle's engagement ring. Worked on an
early draft of the PWA blog post. Built a simple theme for hyper (okay it was
very few lines of code :) ). Almost done with day 15 of JS30.

Today is my little brother's birthday. He turned 3 today! He made my day. I went ring shopping for my cousin. There's stunning beauty in diamond in hand ... just saying.  Caught up with Isha. 

# 01/18/2017
Ruth is stateside so super excited to catch up with her.

Back on track with my weekly schedule. Had a lot of fun clubbing/hanging out
with friends on Thursday, Friday, and at a friend and colleagues house party.
Pumped for a productive week ahead. Went running today after a hiatus of about
4-5 months. Learned today that success is on the crossroad of opportunity and
preparation. Caught up with js30.
