- [ ] Haven
  - a solution to find help for those in pressing need of it. The saddest part
    of spending winters in New York or other cities around the US is seeing the
    sheer number of people without homes. Those of them that want help need
    help and there should be a way to inform the authorities or other NGOs about
    their whereabouts 
  - an extension for this is finding a way to restore those of us who are
    broken. This could be a rehabilitation for those without homes. There they
    can gain self esteem through skill building to be re-integrated into the
    society. Need to research more on this.
- [ ] You can have a better experience.com
  - long name I know. I was going through [Ayse
    Deniz's website](http://adpianist.com/bio/). She's a talented artist. She
    has great content on there. I think it would be great to have a web page
    translator of some sort. Think of it as the magic mirror that makes
    everything beautiful. 
    
    You can view a terribly formatted or designed web page in a new way. There
    are obvious technical difficulties to this but it could work off of what the
    webarchive does. Just a thought.
